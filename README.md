This repo is now archived. The updated and current examples for the [The Nature of Code book](https://natureofcode.com/) can be found listed on the [examples page](https://natureofcode.com/examples) on the website.

There are multiple ways to **find the code** for the examples:

* Select the image of the example or the **pink book** icon underneath it to navigate to where the example appears in the book and select `Open in Web Editor`.
* Select the pink `p5.js` link under the given example from the [examples page](https://natureofcode.com/examples).
* The [pexamples can also be found in the content directory](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book-2/tree/main/content/examples) of the book's repository. However, please note that this directory is generated from the p5.js web editor and any [example corrections should be filed as GitHub issues](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book-2/issues).
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> What appears is the outdated documentation of the examples from the 2012 edition of The Nature of Code.
